# SQL For Data Analysis By Udacity

Hey There. This is my entire learning of SQL course of Udacity. This course taught me from Basic Syntax to Advanced JOINs & Performance Tuning. It is one the best courses I've come accross not because It is free but because it offered the premium content and features for free such as video tutorial,quiz and solutions for that quiz for every concept in every module. Though I went through differernt courses in other platforms, learned most from here. Also I highly recommend this to everyone but remember this takes huge amount of patience and practice. Huge thanks to [Udacity](https://learn.udacity.com) for offering this course for free. Here's the [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198).
